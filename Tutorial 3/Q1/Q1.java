/* 
1) Draw a real picture for single level inheritance. 
Perform following tasks.
Task 1: Create a class 
Task 2: Add few data members as private, protected and public
Task 3: Add few methods as public to work on defined data members
Task 4: Create another applicable class which inherits members from above class
Task 5: Add few data members as private, protected and public into second class
Task 6: Add few methods as public to work on defined data members into second class
Task 7: Create a Demo class with main method.
Task 8: Create at least two objects of a second class defined in Task 4 into main method and call all methods using that object.
Task 9: Write comment for each important portion of code like data membersâ€™ declaration, methods, some important logic etc.
Task 10: Summarize above solution in your own few words to visualize the solution to the end user.
