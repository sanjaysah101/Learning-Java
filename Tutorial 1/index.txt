Q1. Write a program to print your profile.
Q2. Write a program to print 1 to 10 numbers.
Q3. Write a program to print odd numbers between 1 to 20.
Q4. Write a program to find the simple interest and print it.
Q5. Write a program to demonstrate the use of switch statement.

Q6. WAP to input any number n and print the product of all its digits.
	For e.g. if n=235 then print 5*3*2=30

Q7. The following program contains more than 10 errors. Correct the errors and submit a working version of the program. (also include comments) The corrected version of the program should produce the following output:

        public class Oops {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                int x;
                System.out.println("x is " x);
                int x = 15.2;   // set x to 15.2
                System.out println("x is now + x");
                int y;   // set y to 1 more than x
                y = int x + 1;
                System.println("x and y are " + x + and + y);
                System.out.println(This program surely cannot )
                System.out.println("have any "errors" in it");
            }
        }

        Output:
        x is 0
        x is now 15
        x and y are 15 and 16
        This program surely cannot
        Have any “errors” in it

Q8. Trace the evaluation of the following expressions, and give their resulting values. Make sure to give a value of the appropriate type (such as including a .0 at the end of a double).
        “1”+2
        4.0 / 2 * 9 / 2	
        2.5 * 2 + 8 / 5.0 + 10 / 3	
        12 / 7 * 4.4 * 2 / 4	
        4 * 3 / 8 + 2.5 * 2	
        (5 * 7.0 / 2 - 2.5) / 5 * 2	
        41 % 7 * 3 / 5 + 5 / 2 * 2.5	
        10.0 / 2/4	
        8 / 5 + 13 / 2 / 3.0	
        2 * 3 / 4 * 2 / 4.0 + 4.5 - 1	
        89 % 10 / 4 * 2.0 / 5 + (1.5 + 1.0 / 2) * 2
        1 + 0 + "0" + 5 * 10

Q9. Find errors you will get and correct those errors.
        int x=2.2;
        String s=’s’;
        Int product=3*5.2*4;
        String myFirstName=’Kasey’;
        System.out.println(myfirstname);

Q10. Rearrange this code to get desired output. (Feel free to add as many of curly braces as you need)
        x++;
        if(x==1) {
        System.out.println(x+” “+y);
        Class MultiFor {
        for(int y=4;y>2;y--){
        for(int x=0;x<4;x++) {
        Public static void main(String [] args){
        Output
        0 4
        0 3
        1 4
        1 3
        3 4
        3 3

Q11. Fill in the missing code:
public class DooBee {
public static void main (String[] args) {
int x=1;
while (x <______){
System.out._____ ("Doo");
System.out._____ (“Bee");
x = x+1;
}
if(x==____ ){
System.out.print("Do”);
} 
}
}
Output
DooBeeDooBeeDo

Q12. Predict the output and add comments what each line of code Is doing.
1. class Test {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
        for(int i = 0; true; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
            break;
        }
      }
   }

2. public class Switch{
    final static short x = 2;
    public static int y = 0;
    public static void main(String [] args) 
    {
        for (int z=0; z < 3; z++) 
        {
            switch (z) 
            {
                case x: System.out.print("0 ");
                case x-1: System.out.print("1 ");
                case x-2: System.out.print("2 ");
             }
         }
     }
   }

Q13. Write a program to perform following tasks.
        Task 1 : Declare one static variable.
        Task 2 : Take at least one input from user and store it in variable.
        Task 3 : Perform type casting on any variable.
        Task 4 : Add at least one control statement.
        Task 5 : Add at least one loop.
        Task 6 : Write comment for each important portion of code like data members’ declaration, methods, some important logic etc.
        Task 7: Summarize above solution in your own few words to visualize the solution to the end user.


Q14. Write a program that includes more than ten string manipulation methods such as length(),concat(),trim() .
        Task 1 : Create a character array.
        Task 2 : Convert character array in String.
        Task 3 : Create a String object using literal.
        Task 4 : Create a String object using new keyword.
        Task 5 : Ask user to enter a name and store user’s name in String.
        Task 6 : Compare two Strings.
        Task 7 : Concat two Strings.
        Task 8 : Perform any ten String manipulation methods.
        Task 6 : Write comment for each important portion of code like data members’ declaration, methods, some important logic etc.
